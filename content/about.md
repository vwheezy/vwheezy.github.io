Thanks for stopping by! I'm a recently graduated Software Developer in the San
Diego area. I've worked with all technologies from building MER/VN full stack
applications to OS device driver development in Rust to Arduino and general
microcontroller programming.

Right now, I'm interested in developing web extensions, plunging myself deeper
into the Rust ecosystem, and finding open source projects to contribute to.
In my free time, I'm an avid homelabber/tinkerer, gardener, baker, gym rat, and
poor guitar player.

I love chatting with people -- [contact me](/). I love being employed --
check out [my resume](/resume.pdf). I love tinkering with shit -- see [my adventures](/posts).
