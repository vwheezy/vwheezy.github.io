Welcome to my corner of the internet where I'll be sharing my musings, thoughts,
and projects (both successful and failed). I'm hoping the documentation of what
I'm up to will keep me accountable and push me to create new, fun things!

Creating this blog has been a big step for me. A couple of years ago, while working
on secure operating systems at [Mars Research Group](https://mars-research.github.io/)
I dove into the futile world of personal privacy and security and it consumed me.
In the years following, I've learned to reel back the worry, but putting my name
out there is still a scary premise.

All of this to say, I'm proud of getting my thoughts and work in the public sphere;
I hope you can find some value in my ramblings :smiley:.

P.S. If you want to hire me, check out my contact info [on the homepage](/).
